# Aragon OSx Plugin Template üöÄ

Welcome to the Foundry template for OSx plugins!

This template is designed to help get developers up and running in a few minutes.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Foundry**: Configured with the right dependencies and settings for Aragon OSx.
- **Examples**: Example plugins and scripts to showcase the most typical scenarios.
- **Testing environment**: A set of tools to help you test your new DAO deployment.

A few variants and options are provided for convenience, while keeping the template as lean as possible. [See below](#template-variants);

## Prerequisites üìã
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- Git
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (optional)

## Getting Started üèÅ

To get started, clone this repository and run the initial commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aragon/osx-plugin-template-foundry my-plugin
cd my-plugin && rm -Rf .git && git init .
cp .env.example .env
make init
forge build
```

Edit `.env` to match your desired network and settings.

### Installing dependencies

```sh
forge install <github-org>/<repo-name>  # replace accordingly

# Use the version you need
cd lib/<repo-name>
git checkout v1.9.0

# Commit the version to use
cd -
git add lib/<repo-name>
git commit -m"Using repo-name v1.9.0"
```

Add the new package to `remappings.txt`:

```txt
@organiation/repo-name/=lib/repo-name
```

### Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` is the target launcher of the project. It's the recommended way to operate the repository. It manages the env variables of common tasks and executes only the steps that need to be run.

```
$ make
Available targets:

- make help               Display the available targets

- make init               Check the dependencies and prompt to install if needed
- make clean              Clean the build artifacts

Testing lifecycle:

- make test               Run unit tests, locally
- make test-fork          Run fork tests, using RPC_URL
- make test-coverage      Generate an HTML coverage report under ./report

- make sync-tests         Scaffold or sync test definitions into solidity tests
- make check-tests        Checks if the solidity test files are out of sync
- make markdown-tests     Generates a markdown file with the test definitions rendered as a tree

Deployment targets:

- make predeploy          Simulate a protocol deployment
- make deploy             Deploy the protocol, verify the source code and write to ./artifacts

Verification:

- make verify-etherscan   Verify the last deployment on an Etherscan (compatible) explorer
- make verify-blockscout  Verify the last deployment on BlockScout
- make verify-sourcify    Verify the last deployment on Sourcify

- make refund             Refund the remaining balance left on the deployment account
```

### Initial set up

Create your `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, set the values of `.env` according to your environment.

Run `make init`:
- It ensures that the dependencies are installed
- It runs a first compilation of the project

## Template Variants üåà

In order to accommodate a wide range of cases, this repo provides comprehensive examples for the following variants:

### Plugin types

- [UUPS upgradeable plugin](./src/MyUpgradeablePlugin.sol)
- [Cloneable plugin](./src/MyCloneablePlugin.sol)
- [Static plugin](./src/MyStaticPlugin.sol)

Update the `constructor()` and `prepareInstallation()` on the [plugin setup](./src/setup/MyPluginSetup.sol) to make it target the variant of your choice.

For upgradeable plugins, consider inheriting from `PluginUpgradeableSetup` instead of `PluginSetup`.

### Deployment flows

- [Deploying a plugin repository](./script/DeploySimple.s.sol) (simple)
- [Deploying a DAO with plugin(s) installed](./script/DeployDaoWithPlugins.s.sol)
- [Deploying a DAO with plugin(s) via a Factory (trustless)](./script/DeployViaFactory.s.sol)

Update `DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT` in `Makefile` to make it use the deployment script of your choice.

### DAO builders (for testing)

- [Simple builder](./test/builders/SimpleBuilder.sol)
  - It creates a simple DAO with the available plugin(s) installed
  - It uses convenient defaults while allowing to override when needed
- [Fork Builder](./test/builders/ForkBuilder.sol)
  - It returns a full DAO setup with the available plugin(s) installed
  - It creates a network fork and uses the configured `DAO_FACTORY_ADDRESS` and `PLUGIN_REPO_FACTORY_ADDRESS` for simulating deployments
  - Like before, it uses convenient defaults while allowing to override when needed

## Testing üîç

Using `make`:

```
$ make
[...]
Testing lifecycle:

- make test             Run unit tests, locally
- make test-coverage    Generate an HTML coverage report under ./report
```

Run `make test` or `forge test -vvv` to check the logic's accordance to the specs.

### Writing tests

Optionally, test hierarchies can be described using yaml files like [ProtocolFactory.t.yaml](./test/ProtocolFactory.t.yaml), which will be transformed into solidity files by running `make sync-tests`, thanks to [bulloak](https://github.com/alexfertel/bulloak).

Create a file with `.t.yaml` extension within the `test` folder and describe a hierarchy as follows:

```yaml
# MyTest.t.yaml

MyContractTest:
- given: proposal exists
  comment: Comment here
  and:
  - given: proposal is in the last stage
    and:

    - when: proposal can advance
      then:
      - it: Should return true

    - when: proposal cannot advance
      then:
      - it: Should return false

  - when: proposal is not in the last stage
    then:
    - it: should do A
      comment: This is an important remark
    - it: should do B
    - it: should do C

- when: proposal doesn't exist
  comment: Testing edge cases here
  then:
  - it: should revert
```

Then use `make` to automatically sync the described branches into solidity test files.

```sh
$ make
Testing lifecycle:
# ...
- make sync-tests       Scaffold or sync tree files into solidity tests
- make check-tests      Checks if solidity files are out of sync
- make markdown-tests   Generates a markdown file with the test definitions rendered as a tree

$ make sync-tests
```

Each yaml file will generate (or sync) a solidity test file with functions ready to be implemented. It will also generate a human readable summary in [TESTS.md](./TESTS.md) file.

### Testing with a local OSx

You can deploy an in-memory, local OSx deployment to run your E2E tests on top of.

```sh
forge install aragon/protocol-factory
```

You may need to set `via_ir` to `true` on `foundry.toml`.

Given that this repository already depends on OSx, you may want to replace the existing `remappings.txt` entry and use the OSx path provided by `protocol-factory` itself.

```diff
-@aragon/osx/=lib/osx/packages/contracts/src/

+@aragon/protocol-factory/=lib/protocol-factory/
+@aragon/osx/=lib/protocol-factory/lib/osx/packages/contracts/src/
```

Then, use the protocol factory to deploy OSx and use them as you need.

```solidity
// Set the path according to your remappings.txt file
import {ProtocolFactoryBuilder} from "@aragon/protocol-factory/test/helpers/ProtocolFactoryBuilder.sol";

// Prepare an OSx factory
ProtocolFactory factory = new ProtocolFactoryBuilder().build();
factory.deployOnce();

// Get the protocol addresses
ProtocolFactory.Deployment memory deployment = factory.getDeployment();
console.log("DaoFactory", deployment.daoFactory);
```

You can even [customize your local OSx test environment](https://github.com/aragon/protocol-factory?tab=readme-ov-file#if-you-need-to-override-some-parameters) if needed.

## Deployment üöÄ

Check the available make targets to simulate and deploy the smart contracts:

```
- make predeploy        Simulate a protocol deployment
- make deploy           Deploy the protocol and verify the source code
```

### Deployment Checklist

  - [ ] I am the only person of the ceremony that will operate the deployment wallet
- [ ] All the tests run clean (`make test`)
- My computer:
  - [ ] Is running in a safe location and using a trusted network
  - [ ] It exposes no services or ports
    - MacOS: `sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -nP`
    - Linux: `netstat -tulpn`
    - Windows: `netstat -nao -p tcp`
  - [ ] The wifi or wired network in use does not expose any ports to a WAN

### Post deployment checklist

- [ ] The deployment process completed with no errors
- [ ] The factory contract was deployed by the deployment address
- [ ] All the project's smart contracts are correctly verified on the reference block explorer of the target network.
- [ ] The output of the latest `logs/deployment-<network>-<date>.log` file corresponds to the console output
- [ ] A file called `artifacts/addresses-<network>-<timestamp>.json` has been created, and the addresses match those logged to the screen
- [ ] I have uploaded the following files to a shared location:
  - `logs/deployment-<network>.log` (the last one)
  - `artifacts/addresses-<network>-<timestamp>.json`  (the last one)
  - `broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/<chain-id>/run-<timestamp>.json` (the last one)
- [ ] The rest of members confirm that the values are correct
- [ ] I have transferred the remaining funds of the deployment wallet to the address that originally funded it
  - `make refund`

This concludes the deployment ceremony.

## Contract source verification

When running a deployment with `make deploy`, Foundry will attempt to verify the contracts on the corresponding block explorer.

If you need to verify on multiple explorers or the automatic verification did not work, you have three `make` targets available:

```
$ make
[...]
Verification:

- make verify-etherscan   Verify the last deployment on an Etherscan (compatible) explorer
- make verify-blockscout  Verify the last deployment on BlockScout
- make verify-sourcify    Verify the last deployment on Sourcify
```

These targets use the last deployment data under `broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/<chain-id>/run-latest.json`.
- Ensure that the required variables are set within the `.env` file.
- Ensure that `NETWORK_NAME` is listed on the right section under `constants.mk`, according to the block explorer that you want to target

This flow will attempt to verify all the contracts in one go, but yo umay still need to issue additional manual verifications, depending on the circumstances.

### Routescan verification (manual)

```sh
$ forge verify-contract <address> <path/to/file.sol>:<contract-name> --verifier-url 'https://api.routescan.io/v2/network/<testnet|mainnet>/evm/<chain-id>/etherscan' --etherscan-api-key "verifyContract" --num-of-optimizations 200 --compiler-version 0.8.28 --constructor-args <args>
```

Where:
- `<address>` is the address of the contract to verify
- `<path/to/file.sol>:<contract-name>` is the path of the source file along with the contract name
- `<testnet|mainnet>` the type of network
- `<chain-id>` the ID of the chain
- `<args>` the constructor arguments
  - Get them with `$(cast abi-encode "constructor(address param1, uint256 param2,...)" param1 param2 ...)`
