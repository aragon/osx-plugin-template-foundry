# Aragon OSx Plugin Foundry Template 🚀

Welcome to the Solidity Foundry template for building plugins for Aragon OSx! 

This template is designed to help developers quickly set up and start creating powerful decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) plugins using Solidity and Foundry.

## Features ✨

- **Pre-configured Foundry Environment**: Set up with all necessary dependencies and configurations for Aragon OSx.
- **Sample Contracts**: Example plugins to demonstrate integration and usage.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Pre-written tests to ensure your plugins work as expected.

## Prerequisites 📋
- Node.js
- Foundry
- Git
  
## Getting Started 🏁
